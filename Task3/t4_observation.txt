No matter what permissions a user has set, as the root user, we have access to any file on the system.
Hence as the root user i can easily search for any file inside all of the directories regardless of the policies.

As a group member i can also search for the file using the file command inside the directories of which the group user has access.

However, as a non group member, it is unable to access a directory other than my name directory and cannot locate the file
using the find command as I am prompted with a premission denied error.
